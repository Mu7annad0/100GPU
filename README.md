# 100 Days of GPU Challenge
This repository is a part of the 100 Days of GPU Challenge, a 100-day long challenge to learn GPU programming.

| Day | Kernel | Description |
| --- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| 1 | Vector Addition | Implemented a basic element-wise addition kernel using CUDA to add two vectors. <br /> Read the first two chapters from the PMPP Book. |
| 2 | Matrix Addition | Implemented a basic matrix Addition kernel using CUDA to add two matrices. |
| 3 | RGB to Grayscale Conversion | Implemented a RGB to Grayscale Conversion kernel using CUDA. <br /> Read the first 2 sections from the third chapter of the PMPP Book. |
| 4 | Blur a RGB Image | Implemented a Blur rgb image conversion kernel using CUDA. <br /> Read the section 3 from the PMPP Book, and also this [blog](https://michalpitr.substack.com/p/gpu-programming).|
| 5 | Matrix Multiplication | Implemented a Matrix Multiplication kernel using CUDA.<br />  Finished chapter 3 of PMPP Book. |
| 6 | Matrix Transpose | Implemented a Matrix Transpose kernel using CUDA. <br /> Started reading Chapter 4 and gained a comprehensive understanding of the architecture of modern CUDA-capable GPUs, including block scheduling, synchronization, and transparent scalability.|
